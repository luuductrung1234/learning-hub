## Locality of data

### Catching

> The purpose of caching:
>
> -   To eliminate the need, in many cases, to request information the caller already has
>
> -   To eliminate the need, in many other situations, to send full HTTP responses

### Mirror data

> Replacing a query to another microservice with a query to the microserviceâ€™s own database by creating a `read model`: a data model that can be queried easily and efficiently.
>
> Read models are often based on **events** from other microservices.
>
> Read models can also be built from **responses to queries** to other microservices
